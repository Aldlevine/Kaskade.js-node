Kaskade.js-node
===============

A Node.js based reactive data library. Combines elements derived from Knockout.js, Angular.js, and Meteor.js to create a well rounded, powerful but lightweight framework that focuses on both data transport and reactive UI features. A similar environment to Meteor, but allows for greater flexibilty especially in data storage. (Also, it's way faster than Meteor).
